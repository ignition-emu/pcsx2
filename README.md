# PCEE2 — PCSX2 libretro core

![Libretro Core Builds](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/WizzardSK/pcee2-libretro/libretro_builds.yml?branch=libretro&label=core%20builds)
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/WizzardSK/pcee2-libretro)](https://github.com/WizzardSK/pcee2-libretro/releases/latest)

A [libretro](https://www.libretro.com/) core frontend for the current PCSX2
codebase, letting RetroArch (and other libretro frontends) run PS2 games with
an up-to-date emulation core.

Unlike [LRPS2](https://github.com/libretro/ps2) — a hard fork of an older
PCSX2 snapshot — this port keeps the libretro layer *additive*: the emulation
core is tracked from [upstream PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2) with a
minimal set of hooks, so rebasing onto new upstream releases stays cheap.

The core reports the upstream PCSX2 version it is built from, so the version
RetroArch shows names the standalone PCSX2 the emulation code corresponds to —
currently **v2.7.523**. See [Upstream sync and versioning](#upstream-sync-and-versioning).

On the Vulkan renderer the core shares the frontend's `VkDevice` through
libretro context negotiation and hands over the rendered image directly, with
no GPU readback in the way. Everything else (OpenGL, software, D3D, Metal, or a
frontend that refuses HW render) falls back to the per-frame readback path,
which is double-buffered on the GS thread and costs one frame of latency;
`PCEE2_READBACK=1` forces it on Vulkan too, for A/B testing.

## Download

Grab the latest core from the [Releases page](https://github.com/WizzardSK/pcee2-libretro/releases)
and copy everything in the zip into your RetroArch `cores` directory. The
cores are statically linked single files (Linux `.so`, Windows `.dll`); macOS
additionally ships `libMoltenVK.dylib` (the Vulkan driver) next to the core,
and needs the quarantine flag cleared once:
`xattr -cr ~/Library/Application\ Support/RetroArch/cores`.

Per-commit builds are available as artifacts of the
[Libretro Core Builds](https://github.com/WizzardSK/pcee2-libretro/actions/workflows/libretro_builds.yml)
workflow.

## Setup

1. Put a PS2 BIOS dump into `<retroarch system dir>/pcsx2/bios/`.
2. Optional: copy the `resources` directory from a PCSX2 installation of the same version (or from `bin/resources` of this repo) to `<retroarch system dir>/pcsx2/resources/`. The shaders and fonts the core cannot start without are compiled into it, so this only adds the game database and patches; `PCEE2_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES=1` makes the on-disk copies win over the built-in ones.
3. For built-in game patches (including the widescreen / no-interlacing options), download [`patches.zip`](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2_patches/releases/latest/download/patches.zip) into `<retroarch system dir>/pcsx2/resources/patches.zip`.
4. Load a disc image (`.iso`, `.chd`, `.cso`, `.gz`, `.bin`, `.mdf`, `.nrg`, `.elf`) with the core.
5. Optional: copy your standalone `PCSX2.ini` to `<retroarch system dir>/pcsx2/inis/PCSX2.ini` — the core adopts its emulation settings (EmuCore, speed hacks, CPU, GS, game fixes, memory cards, DEV9 network/HDD) as the baseline. Core options still override their respective settings.

Memory cards, savestates metadata, cache, etc. live under
`<retroarch system dir>/pcsx2/`.

## Building (Linux)

```sh
# distro packages (Ubuntu/KDE neon)
sudo apt install -y cmake ninja-build clang liblz4-dev libwebp-dev \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev libpcap-dev libfontconfig-dev libudev-dev \
  libx11-dev libxrandr-dev extra-cmake-modules libwayland-dev libegl-dev libdbus-1-dev

# deps not packaged usably by distros (SDL3, plutovg, plutosvg, rapidyaml,
# libbacktrace, shaderc — Ubuntu's libshaderc_combined.a is not self-contained):
bash pcee2-libretro/scripts/build-deps-linux.sh "$PWD/deps"

cmake -B build-libretro -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DENABLE_QT_UI=OFF -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_LIBRETRO=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/deps \
  -DSHADERC_STATIC=ON -DSHADERC_LIBRARY=$PWD/deps/lib/libshaderc_combined.a
ninja -C build-libretro pcee2-libretro
# -> build-libretro/bin/pcee2_libretro.so
```

Windows (MSVC) and macOS use the matching static dependency scripts in
`pcee2-libretro/scripts/` — see `.github/workflows/libretro_builds.yml` for
the exact steps on all three platforms.

settings; anything not exposed yet runs at the standalone default (including
automatic per-game fixes from the GameDB).

## Architecture notes

- The frontend (`pcee2-libretro/Libretro.cpp`) is modeled on `pcsx2-gsrunner`:
  a dedicated CPU thread runs the `VMManager::Execute()` loop, and
  `Host::PumpMessagesOnCPUThread()` paces it 1:1 against `retro_run()`.
- Frames leave the GS thread through `VKLibretro`
  (`pcsx2/GS/Renderers/Vulkan/VKLibretro.cpp`), which publishes the rendered
  `VkImage` to `retro_run()` for `set_image`; the fallback path uses
  `GSSetFramebufferReadback()`, a double-buffered readback on the GS thread
  added for this port (`GSRenderer.cpp`).
- Audio is pulled from a custom `AudioStream` registered through
  `SPU2::CustomOutputStreamFactory`.
- Savestates use `SaveState_ZipToBuffer`/`SaveState_UnzipFromBuffer`
  (in-memory variants of the existing zip paths).
- The CPU thread and PCSX2's process-level state (signal handlers, JIT
  memory) live for the whole core lifetime and are reused across
  RetroArch's deinit/init content cycles, mirroring the Qt frontend's
  lifetime model.
- Core modifications beyond these hooks are intentionally minimal; see
  `git log --oneline pcsx2up/master..libretro -- pcsx2/ common/` for the
  full delta (`pcsx2up` = the PCSX2 remote, see below).

## Upstream sync and versioning

`pcee2-libretro/upstream.version` records the upstream PCSX2 release the
emulation code is merged up to. The build reads it and reports that version as
the core version — in RetroArch's core info, in the Vulkan application version
and in the version stamped into savestates — instead of describing pcee2's own
git tags, which say nothing about which PCSX2 is inside. `bin/resources` from
the same PCSX2 version is the matching set.

Syncing to a newer PCSX2:

```sh
git remote add pcsx2up https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2.git   # once
git fetch pcsx2up master --tags
git merge pcsx2up/master
# then bump PCSX2_VERSION / PCSX2_COMMIT in pcee2-libretro/upstream.version
# to `git describe --tags pcsx2up/master` and its commit
```

CMake warns when the recorded commit is not an ancestor of the tree being
built, so a forgotten bump shows up in the build log.
